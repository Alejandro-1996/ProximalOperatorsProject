This project has the aim to study the combination of common image regularizers with nonnegativity constraints in the context of image reconstruction algorithms. Algorithms like ADMM are based on proximal optimization and are guaranteed to converge, but have very high computational requirements due to the variable splitting performed. Furthermore, for sophisticated regularizers like total variation or the Hessian-Schatten norm, the proximal operator is known, but the proximal operator of the regularizer plus the nonnegativity constraint is not, which means that they cannot be treated as a single function during optimization. However, if the proximal operator of the regularizer can be used as input to the proximal operator of the nonnegativity constraint -or vice versa- to recover the proximal operator of the sum of both -a property that is known in the literature for the l1 and l2 norms-, variable splitting can be avoided and computational requirements can be potentially reduced, improving performance. This project uses CVXPy to solve the proximal operators and generate an experimental framework for evaluating the potential for reduced splitting. The experiment was performed for common regularizers like the lp norms, group sparsity, total variation and the Hessian-Schatten norm. Results suggest that nonisometric total variation, group sparsity, and all the lp norms can use the described property for reduced splitting, as it is exemplified in the Figure 1 for an image denoising task.
