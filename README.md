# ProximalOperatorsProject
Repository dedicated to the study of image regulatizers and their combination with nonnegativity constraints. The goal is to empirically explore regularizers other than the known <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathrm{L}^1"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mathrm{L}^2"> and their proximal operators.
