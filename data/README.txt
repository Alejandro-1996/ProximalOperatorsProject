The present directory contains the following files:
 * peppers.tiff: used for an image denoising task with the Hessian-Schatten norm image regularizer,
 * peppers_Hessian_Schatten.npy: results of an image denoising task to exemplify the combination of the Hessian-Schatten norm regularizer with nonnegativity constraints,
 * phantom_Hessian_Schatten.npy: results of the same image denoising task with the Hessian-Schatten norm plus nonnegativity constraints, with the Shepp-Logan phantom,
 * phantom_TV_results.npy: results a similar image denoising experiment with nonisometric TV plus nonnegativity constraints, with the Shepp-Logan phantom. 

The rest of the data is generated or loaded inside the notebooks from standard Python packages.
